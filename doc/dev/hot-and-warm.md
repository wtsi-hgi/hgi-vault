# Hot and Warm Code Index

The hot and warm code system described in the original design.md is no longer
in place because it wasn't doing anything meaningful, and only provided a false
sense of security.

We simply have to be careful and thorough in our reviews and testing, and
carefully trial new locations that sandman will be used on in production.
