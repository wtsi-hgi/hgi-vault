# Please implement the function "can_delete", which takes two positional
# arguments and returns a Boolean result. The arguments are:

# 1. "file", of type core.file.BaseFile
# 2. "threshold", of type core.typing.TimeDelta

# core.file.BaseFile is defined in core/file.py (L25-35)

# core.typing.TimeDelta is a wrapper for datetime.timedelta, from the
# Python standard library [1]

# The function should return truthfully if the file's age meets or exceeds
# the threshold. It should return false, otherwise. (I told you it was
# trivial!)
