# Identity Management
# - ldap        Host (host) and port (port) of the LDAP server
# - users       Base DN (dn) and mappings (attributes) for users
# - groups      Base DN (dn) and mappings (attributes) for groups

# NOTE The following assumptions are made:
# * The server uses simple, bind-less authentication over cleartext
# * The search space of the User and Group trees are their respective
#   subtrees, in their entirety
# * The Group records' owners and members contain the fully qualified
#   DNs of users

# Sandman Persistence
# - postgres    Host (host) and port (port) of PostgreSQL server
# - database    Database name
# - user        Username
# - password    Password

# E-Mail Configuration
# - smtp        Host (host), port (port) and whether to use a secure
#               connection (tls) with the SMTP server
# - sender      E-mail address of the sender

# Deletion Control
# - threshold   Age (in days) after which a file will be soft-deleted.
# - limbo       Age (in days) after which a soft-deleted file will be
#               hard-deleted.
# - warnings    List of warning times (in hours before the deletion age)
#               after which a file's owner and group owner(s) should be
#               notified. Note that no warning should exceed the
#               equivalent of 90 days (2160 hours).

# NOTE These timings are relative to the fidelity at which the batch
# process is run. For example, if it's only run once per week and a
# warning time of one hour is specified, it's very likely that this
# warning will never be triggered.

deletion:
  threshold: 90
  limbo: 14
  warnings:
  - 240  # 10 days' notice
  - 72   # 3 days' notice
  - 24   # 24 hours' notice

# Archival/Downstream Control
# - threshold   Minimum number of staged files to accumulate before
#               draining the queue
# - handler     Path to archiver/downstream handler executable

# NOTE The consumer of the queue is intended to perform the archival,
# however it is not limited to this purpose.

archive:
  threshold: 1000
  handler: /path/to/executable

# min_group_owners defines how many owners must be defined
# in a LDAP group before we can create a Vault/run sandman
# on a project owned by that group
