# Identity Management
# - ldap        Host (host) and port (port) of the LDAP server
# - users       Base DN (dn) and mappings (attributes) for users
# - groups      Base DN (dn) and mappings (attributes) for groups

# NOTE The following assumptions are made:
# * The server uses simple, bind-less authentication over cleartext
# * The search space of the User and Group trees are their respective
#   subtrees, in their entirety
# * The Group records' owners and members contain the fully qualified
#   DNs of users

# Deletion Control
# - threshold   Age (in days) after which a file will be soft-deleted.
# - limbo       Age (in days) after which a soft-deleted file will be
#               hard-deleted.
# - warnings    List of warning times (in hours before the deletion age)
#               after which a file's owner and group owner(s) should be
#               notified. Note that no warning should exceed the
#               equivalent of 90 days (2160 hours).

# NOTE These timings are relative to the fidelity at which the batch
# process is run. For example, if it's only run once per week and a
# warning time of one hour is specified, it's very likely that this
# warning will never be triggered.

  threshold: 90

  warnings:
  - 240  # 10 days' notice
